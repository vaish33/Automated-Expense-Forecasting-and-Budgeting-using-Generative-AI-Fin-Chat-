Hackathon Project : Automated Expense Forecasting and Budgeting using Generative AI (Fin Chat)

Hackathon: Agilisium Hackathon – Team: Mindful Machines

Tools & Technologies: OpenAI API (GPT-4.0), ARIMA, Streamlit, Pandas, NumPy, Plotly

Description:
As part of the Agilisium Hackathon, I have developed a Generative AI-powered solution to forecast future IT project expenses and provide intelligent budgeting recommendations. The project integrates statistical time series forecasting (ARIMA) with OpenAI's GPT-3.5 for contextual financial insights. Built using Streamlit, the interactive web app enables users to upload expense datasets, visualize trends using Plotly, and receive both data-driven and AI-generated budgeting advice. This solution showcases the synergy of traditional forecasting models with GenAI for smarter financial planning.
